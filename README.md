ðŸ‘‹ Personal Research Projects on Simulation, Production-IT & Digital Twins
This repository contains personal research-related work and experiments in the context of:
- Automated generation of simulation models
- Digital twin architecture concepts
- Production IT and Assembly IT (with practical experience)
- Exploration of digital product passports and their implementation
The content here reflects my ongoing interests and side projects as a professional researcher. It's not an official research repositoryâ€”just a place to try things out, document ideas, and explore topics I'm actively working on or curious about.
